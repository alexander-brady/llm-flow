      Which moral foundation does this ad primarily appeal to? Choose one from the following list:

      Moral Foundations:
        Care/Harm: It suggests that someone other than the speaker is worthy of compassion or is experiencing harm, grounded in the values of kindness, tenderness, and care.
        Fairness/Cheating: Emphasizes justice, personal rights, and independence; involves comparing with other groups. Advocates for equal opportunity and resists those who benefit without contributing (``Free Riders").
        Loyalty/Betrayal: Based on the values of loyalty to one's country and willingness to sacrifice for the group. Activated by a sense of unity and collective responsibilityâ€”``one for all, and all for one".
        Authority/Subversion: Centers on showing respect (or resistance) toward established authority and following long-standing traditions. It includes maintaining social order and fulfilling the duties tied to hierarchical roles, such as obedience, respect, and role-based responsibilities.
        Sanctity/Degradation: Beyond religion, this value highlights respect for human dignity and aversion to moral or physical corruption, promoting purity, self-control, and the belief that the body is sacred and vulnerable to defilement.
        Liberty/Oppression: Captures the feelings of reactance and resentment people experience when their freedom is restricted, often leading to collective disdain for authoritarian figures and motivating unity and resistance against oppression.
